New energy vehicles have gained widespread popularity since their introduction, due to their advanced technology, low fuel consumption, and alignment with the global carbon peak and carbon neutrality goals around the world. This paper extensively gathers data on new energy vehicles, traditional fuel-powered cars, and related information. Finally, a series of mathematical models to describe the development of new energy vehicles are established.

For problem 1, 

\textbf{NOTE} that data should be demonstrated here.

For problem 2, 

Ultimately, we provide a summary of the data and mathematical models employed in this study and look ahead to potential future works.

New energy vehicles integrate transformative technologies such as new energy sources, new materials, and various disruptive technologies like the internet, big data, and artificial intelligence. This integration propels the transformation of energy, transportation, and information communication infrastructure, fostering an optimized energy consumption structure, elevating the intelligence level of transportation systems and urban operations. This advancement holds significant importance in constructing a clean and beautiful world, and in building a shared future for humanity.

The widespread adoption of new energy vehicles holds particular significance for China. With a large population, China faces substantial carbon emissions from automobiles. The popularization of new energy vehicles will greatly reduce China's energy expenditure and stands as a robust initiative toward achieving ecological civilization.

Within the realm of new energy vehicles, the development of new energy electric vehicles has been particularly rapid. This is primarily due to their low pollution and low energy consumption characteristics. Additionally, new energy electric vehicles typically offer a affordable price, thus enjoying a broad market in China.

This paper collects comprehensive data on China's new energy electric vehicles, including their sales volume, growth rates, traditional car sales, export quantities, and China's policies supporting new energy vehicles. Further, this paper employs methods such as \textbf{xx} and \textbf{xx} to model and analyze the development of China's new energy electric vehicles and their associated impacts.
